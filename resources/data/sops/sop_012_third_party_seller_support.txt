Version: 1.4
Last Updated: 2025-01-17
Department: Marketplace Support / Customer Support
---

PURPOSE:
Handle customer inquiries related to products sold by third-party sellers on our marketplace platform, facilitating resolution between customer and seller while protecting platform standards.

SCOPE:
Covers all orders where "Sold by: [Third-Party Seller Name]" appears in order details. Does not cover items sold directly by our company (use standard SOPs for those).

PREREQUISITES:
- Access to Marketplace Seller Portal (view-only for customer support)
- Understanding of marketplace policies and seller agreements
- Cannot directly refund/resolve on behalf of seller (only facilitate)
- Escalation path to Marketplace Operations team

PROCEDURE:

1. IDENTIFY THIRD-PARTY SELLER ORDER

   A. CHECK ORDER DETAILS:
      - Look for "Sold by: [Seller Name]" field
      - If says "Sold by: [Our Company Name]" → Use standard SOPs (not this one)
      - If says "Sold by: [Third-Party Name]" → This SOP applies

   B. SELLER TYPES IN OUR MARKETPLACE:
      - Fulfilled by Seller (FBS): Seller ships from their own warehouse
      - Fulfilled by Us (FBU): Seller stores inventory in our warehouse, we ship
      - Hybrid: Some items FBS, some FBU (check per-order)

   C. GATHER SELLER INFO:
      - Seller name and ID
      - Seller performance metrics:
        * Order defect rate (target: <1%)
        * Late shipment rate (target: <4%)
        * Customer response time (target: <24 hours)
        * Seller rating (1-5 stars)
      - Seller status: Active, Under Review, Suspended

2. CUSTOMER ISSUE CLASSIFICATION

   Common issues with marketplace orders:

   A. SHIPMENT ISSUES (~40%):
      - Item not received
      - Item arrived late
      - Tracking not provided
      - Wrong shipping method used

   B. PRODUCT ISSUES (~35%):
      - Wrong item sent
      - Damaged or defective
      - Not as described
      - Missing parts/accessories

   C. RETURN/REFUND ISSUES (~15%):
      - Seller not responding to return request
      - Seller refusing valid return
      - Return address unclear
      - Refund not issued after return

   D. SELLER COMMUNICATION ISSUES (~10%):
      - Seller not responding to messages
      - Seller providing conflicting information
      - Language barrier

3. INITIAL RESPONSE & TRIAGE

   A. HAS CUSTOMER CONTACTED SELLER DIRECTLY?
      - Check message history in Marketplace Messages
      - If NO: Direct customer to contact seller first (except urgent cases)
      - If YES but no response >48 hours: Proceed with facilitation
      - If YES and seller responded but dispute unresolved: Mediate

   B. URGENT CASES (bypass seller contact requirement):
      - Safety issue (dangerous product, contamination)
      - High-value item (>$500) not received
      - Seller appears abandoned (no activity in 7+ days)
      - Obvious violation of marketplace policies

   C. WITHIN MARKETPLACE GUARANTEE TIMEFRAME?
      - Orders <30 days old: Full guarantee applies
      - Orders 31-90 days: Limited guarantee (defects only, not returns)
      - Orders >90 days: Refer to manufacturer warranty (SOP-010)

4. FACILITATION PROCESS

   A. FULFILLED BY SELLER (FBS) ORDERS:
      Seller is responsible for:
      - Shipping
      - Customer service
      - Returns processing
      - Refunds

      Our role:
      - Facilitate communication
      - Enforce marketplace policies
      - Step in if seller unresponsive
      - Protect customer under guarantee

      Action:
      1. Send seller message (template: MKT-SEL-001):
         "Hello [Seller],
         Customer [Name] has reported [issue] with order [ID].
         Please respond within 24 hours with resolution plan.
         Our marketplace policies require [specific policy].
         If unresponsive, we will step in to resolve per guarantee."

      2. Notify customer that seller has been contacted
      3. Set 24-hour follow-up reminder
      4. If seller responds: Monitor resolution
      5. If seller unresponsive: Escalate to Marketplace Operations

   B. FULFILLED BY US (FBU) ORDERS:
      We handle:
      - Shipping
      - Returns processing (item returns to our warehouse)

      Seller handles:
      - Product quality
      - Refund decisions
      - Customer inquiries

      Action:
      - Shipping issues: Handle like standard orders (we shipped it)
      - Product issues: Route to seller for decision
      - Returns: Accept return to our warehouse, await seller refund decision

   C. SELLER UNRESPONSIVE (>48 hours):
      - Escalate to Marketplace Operations team
      - They contact seller via phone/email (escalated channels)
      - If still unresponsive after 72 hours total:
        → Marketplace Operations may issue refund on seller's behalf
        → Funds deducted from seller's account balance
        → Seller penalized for policy violation

5. COMMON RESOLUTION PATHS

   A. ITEM NOT RECEIVED:
      FBS orders:
      - Seller must provide tracking information
      - If no tracking: Seller must refund OR reship
      - If tracking shows delivered but customer claims not received:
        → Investigate with carrier (seller's responsibility)
        → If carrier confirms delivery: Not covered by guarantee
        → If carrier confirms loss: Seller must refund/reship

      FBU orders:
      - We investigate (same process as standard orders)
      - If lost in our shipping: We issue refund/reship
      - Seller not penalized for our shipping failure

   B. WRONG OR DAMAGED ITEM:
      - Require photo evidence from customer
      - Share with seller
      - Seller options:
        * Reship correct item + arrange return of wrong item
        * Full refund + keep wrong item (if low value)
        * Partial refund + keep item (if usable but defective)
      - Seller must respond within 24 hours
      - If seller refuses reasonable resolution: Marketplace Operations forces refund

   C. RETURN REQUEST:
      - Customer wants to return (changed mind, doesn't fit, etc.)
      - Check seller's return policy:
        * Some sellers offer 30-day returns (encouraged)
        * Some offer "no returns" on certain items (allowed for specific categories)
        * Policy must be clearly stated in listing (if not, default 30-day applies)

      - FBS: Seller provides return address and label (or customer pays return shipping)
      - FBU: Return to our warehouse, we process, notify seller, seller issues refund

      - Seller has 2 business days after receiving return to issue refund
      - If seller doesn't refund: Marketplace Operations forces refund + penalty

   D. NOT AS DESCRIBED:
      - Review product listing (screenshots)
      - Compare to customer's description of received item
      - Check if listing was misleading or inaccurate
      - If genuinely not as described:
        → Seller must accept return + full refund (even if "no return" policy)
        → Seller may receive policy violation strike
      - If item matches listing but customer misunderstood:
        → Standard return policy applies (seller not at fault)

6. MARKETPLACE GUARANTEE ACTIVATION

   When seller fails to meet obligations, Marketplace Guarantee ensures customer protection:

   A. GUARANTEE COVERS:
      - Item not received (no tracking or tracking shows lost)
      - Item significantly not as described
      - Item damaged in shipping (FBS only; FBU covered by us)
      - Seller refusing valid return
      - Seller not issuing refund after valid return received

   B. GUARANTEE DOES NOT COVER:
      - Changed mind on "no return" items (if clearly stated)
      - Damage after delivery (customer's fault)
      - Late delivery within reasonable window (<7 days late)
      - Buyer's remorse on correctly described item

   C. GUARANTEE CLAIM PROCESS:
      1. Customer contacts us (after attempting seller contact)
      2. We verify: Issue exists, seller unresponsive/refusing
      3. Marketplace Operations reviews case (usually <24 hours)
      4. If approved: We issue refund to customer
      5. Funds debited from seller account
      6. Seller receives policy violation notice

7. SELLER PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT

   A. POLICY VIOLATIONS (tracked by Marketplace Operations):
      - Minor violations: Warning (excessive late shipments, slow responses)
      - Moderate violations: Account review (multiple customer complaints)
      - Major violations: Suspension (fraud, dangerous products, repeated failures)

      - Pattern of "not as described" complaints
      - Consistent unresponsiveness
      - Suspected counterfeit products
      - Safety concerns

      - "Our Marketplace Guarantee protects you"
      - "We monitor seller performance and remove poor performers"

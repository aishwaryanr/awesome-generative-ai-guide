SOP-007: Account Security & Fraud Prevention
Version: 2.0
Last Updated: 2025-01-25
Department: Customer Support / IT Security / Fraud Prevention
---

PURPOSE:
Protect customer accounts from unauthorized access and fraudulent activity while maintaining a balance between security and customer experience.

SCOPE:
Covers account security measures, fraud detection, investigation procedures, and remediation. Does not cover payment fraud (see SOP-015) or systematic security breaches (IT Security incident response).

PREREQUISITES:
- Agent must have security awareness training (completed annually)
- Access to fraud detection system (elevated permissions required)
- Cannot bypass security protocols without Security team approval
- IMPORTANT: When in doubt about security, escalate - never compromise

PROCEDURE:

1. FRAUD DETECTION TRIGGERS

   System automatically flags accounts based on:

   A. BEHAVIORAL ANOMALIES
      - Login from new country/region (geo-velocity impossible travel)
      - Multiple failed login attempts from different IPs
      - Unusual order patterns (high-value orders after dormancy)
      - Shipping address changes followed immediately by large order
      - Multiple payment methods attempted in short timeframe

   B. ACCOUNT CHARACTERISTICS
      - New account (<7 days old) + high-value order (>$500)
      - Free email domain (gmail, yahoo, hotmail) + business-level order
      - Mismatched info (billing zip doesn't match IP location by >500 miles)
      - Phone number recently associated with different account
      - Email address follows pattern: randomletters123@domain.com

   C. TRANSACTION RED FLAGS
      - Multiple orders to different addresses in 24 hours
      - Orders to freight forwarder addresses (common in fraud)
      - High-value electronics + expedited shipping + new account
      - Gift card purchases >$500 (high fraud category)
      - BIN (Bank Identification Number) from high-risk country

   IMPORTANT: Flags are indicators, not proof
   → ~15% of flagged accounts are legitimate (false positive rate)
   → Goal: Verify, not assume fraud

2. WHEN CUSTOMER CONTACTS ABOUT SECURITY HOLD

   a. Account flagged by system, customer calling to ask why order is held:
      - Explain: "Your account was flagged for routine security verification"
      - Do NOT say: "We think you're a fraudster" or "Your account looks suspicious"
      - Tone: Apologetic for inconvenience, not accusatory

   b. Verification process:
      - Primary identity verification (SOP-004 methods apply)
      - Additional security questions:
        * Why is shipping address different from billing?
        * Is this order for yourself or someone else?
        * Can you verify CVV on payment card? (if applicable)
        * Have you ordered from us before?

   c. Red flags during verification:
      - Customer becomes hostile/pressuring when asked routine questions
      - Cannot explain inconsistencies (e.g., why US billing but ship to Latvia)
      - Knows order details but fails basic account verification
      - Multiple people calling about same order (organized fraud ring)

   d. Resolution:
      - PASS verification: Release hold, expedite order, apologize for delay
      - FAIL verification: Escalate to Fraud Prevention team (do not release)
      - UNCERTAIN: Escalate to supervisor + Fraud Prevention

3. ACCOUNT COMPROMISE INVESTIGATION

   Customer reports: "I didn't place this order" or "Someone accessed my account"

   A. IMMEDIATE TRIAGE (first 5 minutes)
      - Place security hold on account (prevent new orders/changes)
      - Check recent account activity log:
        * Login history (IPs, locations, devices, timestamps)
        * Password change attempts
        * Email/phone number changes
        * Payment method additions/changes
        * Shipping address additions/changes
        * Orders placed in last 30 days

   B. INTERVIEW CUSTOMER
      - When did you notice the unauthorized activity?
      - Do you recognize any of these orders/charges?
      - Have you shared your password with anyone?
      - Do you use the same password on other websites?
      - Have you clicked any suspicious links recently (phishing)?
      - Do family members have access to your account?
      - Have you used public WiFi to access your account?

   C. ASSESS COMPROMISE SEVERITY
      - LOW: Only browsing activity from unknown IP (no orders/changes)
        → Action: Force password reset, enable 2FA, monitor

      - MEDIUM: Unauthorized order placed but not yet shipped
        → Action: Cancel order, reset credentials, remove unauthorized payment methods

      - HIGH: Multiple orders shipped, payment methods changed, email changed
        → Action: Full account lockdown, IT Security investigation, coordinate with payment processor

      - CRITICAL: Evidence of organized fraud ring (multiple accounts, similar patterns)
        → Action: Immediate escalation to Fraud Prevention + Legal + IT Security

   D. CONTAINMENT ACTIONS
      Based on severity:
      1. Cancel pending orders (if not shipped)
      2. Attempt intercept if already shipped (contact carrier/warehouse)
      3. Remove unauthorized payment methods
      4. Remove unauthorized shipping addresses
      5. Reset password (force customer to create new one via secure link)
      6. Enable 2FA (mandatory for compromised accounts)
      7. Log out all active sessions
      8. Generate new session tokens
      9. Flag payment methods as potentially compromised

4. REMEDIATION & CUSTOMER SUPPORT

   A. ISSUE REFUNDS
      - Unauthorized orders (confirmed fraudulent): Full refund
      - Timeline: Immediate (within 24 hours)
      - Method: Original payment method (unless compromised, then alternative)

   B. RECOVER PRODUCTS IF POSSIBLE
      - Shipped but not delivered: Carrier intercept (success rate ~40%)
      - Delivered to freight forwarder: Contact forwarder (success rate ~20%)
      - Delivered to fraudster's address: File police report, low recovery chance

   C. RESTORE ACCOUNT ACCESS
      - Customer creates new strong password (requirements: 12+ chars, mixed case, numbers, symbols)
      - 2FA setup required (SMS or authenticator app)
      - Security questions updated
      - Review authorized devices list
      - Confirm legitimate payment methods and addresses

   D. PROVIDE INCIDENT REPORT
      - Template: SEC-INC-001
      - Include:
        * Timeline of compromise
        * Actions taken by fraudster
        * Financial impact (orders, refunds)
        * How breach likely occurred (if known)
        * Steps customer should take
        * Our security enhancements applied

   E. MONITORING POST-COMPROMISE
      - Flag account for enhanced monitoring (30 days)
      - Any new orders require manual review
      - Payment method additions require extra verification
      - Shipping address changes flagged

5. FRAUD PREVENTION - LEGITIMATE CUSTOMER EDUCATION

   When customer asks "How do I protect my account?":

   a. MUST DO (required):
      - Use strong, unique password (not reused from other sites)
      - Enable two-factor authentication (2FA)
      - Never share password with anyone
      - Log out when using shared/public computers

   b. SHOULD DO (recommended):
      - Use password manager
      - Check account activity monthly
      - Enable email notifications for orders and account changes
      - Be cautious of phishing emails (we never ask for password via email)

   c. WHAT WE DO (our security measures):
      - Encrypted connections (SSL/TLS)
      - Payment data tokenized (we don't store full card numbers)
      - Anomaly detection (flags unusual activity)
      - Regular security audits
      - PCI-DSS compliance (payment card industry standards)

6. HANDLING FALSE POSITIVES (Legitimate customers flagged)

   ~15% of fraud flags are false positives (legitimate customers)

   Common scenarios:
   - Traveling customer orders from hotel WiFi
   - Gift to friend in another country
   - Military/government customer with IP routing through different location
   - VPN user appears to be in different country
   - Customer legitimately has multiple shipping addresses (gifts, vacation home)

   Resolution:
   - Apologize for inconvenience
   - Verify identity thoroughly
   - Add note to account: "Verified legitimate - frequent traveler" (reduces future flags)
   - Release order with expedited shipping as apology
   - Small goodwill gesture (5-10% discount code)

   BALANCE: Security vs Customer Experience
   → Too strict: Lose legitimate customers
   → Too lenient: Fraud losses increase
   → Current metrics: 85% fraud detection rate, 15% false positive rate

7. FRAUD RING DETECTION (Organized Crime)

   Indicators of organized fraud:
   - Multiple accounts with similar naming patterns
   - Multiple accounts using same payment method (but different names)
   - Multiple accounts shipping to same address (different names)
   - Orders placed within minutes of account creation
   - Similar browsing patterns across accounts (likely bot-driven)
   - BIN attacks (testing many cards from same bank)

   DO NOT handle at customer service level:
   → Immediately escalate to Fraud Prevention team
   → They coordinate with:
     * Payment processors
     * Law enforcement (if losses >$10K)
     * Other merchants (fraud info sharing networks)

8. SOCIAL ENGINEERING ATTEMPTS

   Fraudster may call pretending to be customer:

   A. ACCOUNT TAKEOVER ATTEMPT
      - Caller has some info (name, email, maybe order number)
      - Requests: Password reset, email change, add payment method, ship to new address
      - RED FLAGS:
        * Pressures agent to bypass security ("I'm traveling, no access to email")
        * Gets hostile when asked verification questions
        * Has order details but fails basic account verification
        * Calls multiple times with different agents (testing for weak link)

   B. SOCIAL ENGINEERING TACTICS
      - Urgency: "I need this rush shipped today or I'll cancel!"
      - Authority: "I'm the CFO, just make the change"
      - Intimidation: "I'll report you if you don't help me"
      - Sympathy: "My grandma is sick, this gift is urgent"

   C. AGENT RESPONSE
      - Remain calm and professional
      - Follow verification procedures (no exceptions)
      - If caller becomes hostile: "I understand your frustration, but for your account security, I must verify your identity"
      - If caller threatens: Escalate to supervisor immediately
      - If suspicious: Flag account for Fraud Prevention review

   CRITICAL: Never bypass security procedures, even if:
   - Caller is convincing
   - Caller claims to be in urgent situation
   - Caller threatens to close account/leave negative review
   - Caller claims supervisor already approved (verify with supervisor)

9. INSIDER THREAT (Agent Misconduct)

   Agents must NEVER:
   - Access customer account without business reason
   - Share customer information with anyone (internal or external) without authorization
   - Bypass security measures for friends/family
   - Accept bribes or gifts in exchange for account access
   - Use customer payment information for personal benefit

   Violation = Immediate termination + potential criminal charges

   Monitoring:
   - All account access logged and audited
   - Random audits of agent actions
   - Unusual patterns flagged (agent accessing many high-value accounts)

10. DOCUMENTATION

    A. LOG ALL SECURITY INCIDENTS:
       - Case number (format: SEC-YYYY-XXXXX)
       - Account affected
       - Date/time of detection
       - Fraud indicators observed
       - Actions taken
       - Resolution
       - Follow-up required

    B. FRAUD PREVENTION METRICS (tracked weekly):
       - Fraud detection rate (Target: >85%)
       - False positive rate (Target: <20%)
       - Average resolution time (Target: <4 hours)
       - Fraud losses per 1000 orders (Target: <$500)
       - Customer satisfaction after security hold (Target: >70%)

EDGE CASES & EXCEPTIONS:

A) CUSTOMER REFUSES 2FA AFTER COMPROMISE
   - We strongly recommend 2FA
   - Cannot force customer to use 2FA (policy decision)
   - Document refusal: "Customer declined 2FA despite compromise - waives protection"
   - Account remains flagged for manual review

B) MILITARY/GOVERNMENT CUSTOMERS
   - Often have unusual IP patterns (military bases, VPN routing)
   - May have APO/FPO addresses (military post office)
   - Verify using .mil email address or military ID (if provided)
   - Add flag: "Military customer - IP variance expected"

C) CORPORATE BUYER WITH MULTIPLE ADDRESSES
   - Legitimate business ordering to multiple locations
   - Appears like fraud (many addresses, high volume)
   - Verify business legitimacy:
     * Corporate email domain
     * Business tax ID
     * LinkedIn company profile
   - Upgrade to Business Account (B2B portal, different fraud rules)

D) FAMILY SHARING ACCOUNTS
   - Customer shares account with spouse/children
   - "Unauthorized" order actually placed by family member
   - Customer may not know password was shared
   - Resolution: Explain security risk, recommend separate accounts

E) ACCOUNT RECOVERY FOR DECEASED CUSTOMER
   - See SOP-004 (requires death certificate + legal authority)
   - Extra security scrutiny (estate fraud is common)
   - Escalate to Legal team

SYSTEM LIMITATIONS:
- Fraud detection AI has 15% false positive rate (working to reduce)
- IP geolocation accurate within ~50 miles (not precise)
- VPN/proxy users appear in wrong location (hard to distinguish from fraud)
- Device fingerprinting can be spoofed by sophisticated fraudsters
- 2FA via SMS vulnerable to SIM swap attacks (why we also offer authenticator apps)
- Historical fraud data only goes back 2 years (system migration)

FRAUD TYPES & TRENDS (awareness):
- Friendly fraud: Customer makes purchase, then disputes charge (claims "unauthorized")
- Account takeover: Fraudster gains access to legitimate customer account
- New account fraud: Fraudster creates account with stolen identity
- Card testing: Fraudster tests stolen cards with small transactions
- Triangulation fraud: Fraudster uses stolen card to buy from us, ships to victim (complex)
- Refund fraud: Customer claims non-receipt, demands refund, but item delivered

ESCALATION CRITERIA:
- Suspected organized fraud ring: Fraud Prevention team immediately
- Losses >$1,000 on single account: Fraud Prevention + Finance
- Evidence of data breach: IT Security + Legal immediately
- Customer threatens lawsuit over security hold: Legal Compliance
- Media involvement (customer contacting press): PR team + Legal
- Law enforcement requests information: Legal team (do NOT provide directly)

COLLABORATION WITH OTHER TEAMS:
- IT Security: Technical investigation, system hardening
- Fraud Prevention: Pattern analysis, fraud ring tracking
- Legal: Law enforcement coordination, subpoena compliance
- Finance: Chargeback management, loss recovery
- Warehouse: Intercept shipments, verify delivery addresses

NOTES:
- Fraud is constantly evolving - stay updated on new tactics (monthly training)
- Trust your instincts - if something feels off, escalate
- Security vs experience tradeoff: Favor security when unclear
- False positive (annoying legitimate customer) is better than false negative (fraud loss)
- Average fraud loss per incident: $300-800
- Fraud prevention saves ~$50K monthly
- Customer satisfaction after legitimate security hold: Currently 72% (improving)

RELATED SOPS:
- SOP-003: Billing Disputes (unauthorized charges)
- SOP-004: Account Access Issues (password resets, 2FA)
- SOP-015: Chargeback Management (fraud chargebacks)
- SOP-020: Data Privacy & GDPR Compliance

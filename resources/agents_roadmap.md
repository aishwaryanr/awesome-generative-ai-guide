# LLM Agents: From Zero to One

LLM agents are gaining quite some momentum in the generative AI space since they can process feedback, maintain memory, strategize for future actions, and collaborate with various tools to make informed decisions.

If you’ve been looking to learn more about LLM agents and maybe even create your own, this roadmap is just for you! It's filled with great free resources to help you get started and stay up-to-date on what's happening in the world of agents.

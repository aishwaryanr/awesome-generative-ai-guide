SOP-015: Chargeback Management & Dispute Resolution
Version: 1.6
Last Updated: 2025-01-19
Department: Finance / Customer Support / Legal
---

PURPOSE:
Manage chargebacks filed by customers through their banks, including investigation, evidence gathering, representment, and resolution to minimize financial losses and maintain merchant account standing.

SCOPE:
Covers all chargebacks initiated by cardholders through issuing banks. Does not cover refunds requested directly to us (SOP-003) or payment processor disputes that aren't formal chargebacks.

PREREQUISITES:
- Access to chargeback management system (Finance team elevated permissions)
- Understanding of chargeback reason codes (training required)
- Knowledge of card network rules (Visa, Mastercard, Amex, Discover)
- CRITICAL: Strict deadlines - missing a deadline = automatic loss

PROCEDURE:

1. CHARGEBACK NOTIFICATION RECEIVED

   When chargeback filed, we receive notification from payment processor:

   A. NOTIFICATION CONTAINS:
      - Chargeback case number
      - Cardholder name
      - Transaction amount
      - Transaction date
      - Reason code (why customer disputed)
      - Response deadline (typically 7-14 days, varies by network)
      - Provisional credit already given to customer by their bank

   B. IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (within 24 hours):
      - Acknowledge receipt in chargeback system
      - Note response deadline in calendar (with 48-hour buffer)
      - Assign to appropriate team member
      - Pull transaction records from order system

   C. LOCATE CUSTOMER ORDER:
      - Search by transaction date + amount + customer name
      - Cross-reference with payment processor transaction ID
      - Retrieve: Order details, shipping info, tracking, customer communications
      - NOTE: Some older transactions (>90 days) may have limited data (system migration gap)

2. UNDERSTAND CHARGEBACK REASON CODES

   Most common reason codes:

   A. FRAUD CODES (~35% of chargebacks)
      - 10.4 (Visa): Fraudulent transaction - card absent environment
      - 4837 (MC): Fraudulent transaction - no cardholder authorization
      - Customer claims: "I didn't make this purchase"

      Investigation:
      - Check if customer ever contacted us about unauthorized charge
      - Review IP address, device fingerprint, delivery confirmation
      - Check if shipped to cardholder's registered address
      - Look for account access patterns around transaction date

   B. AUTHORIZATION CODES (~5%)
      - 10.1 (Visa): Late presentment (charged card too late after transaction)
      - 4808 (MC): Authorization-related chargeback
      - Usually technical/processing errors on our end

   C. PROCESSING ERROR CODES (~10%)
      - 12.1 (Visa): Late presentment
      - 4834 (MC): Point-of-interaction error
      - Duplicate processing, wrong amount charged, etc.

   D. CONSUMER DISPUTE CODES (~50% of chargebacks)
      - 13.1 (Visa): Merchandise/services not received
      - 13.3 (Visa): Not as described or defective
      - 4853 (MC): Goods/services not received or not as described
      - These are "friendly fraud" - customer should have contacted us first

3. DETERMINE RESPONSE STRATEGY

   Three options:

   A. ACCEPT THE CHARGEBACK
      When to accept:
      - We're clearly at fault (wrong item shipped, item never shipped, refund due but not processed)
      - Transaction is actually fraudulent (customer's claim is legitimate)
      - Evidence is weak/missing (can't prove we're right)
      - Cost of fighting exceeds transaction value (chargeback on $25 order, not worth effort)

      Action:
      - Mark as "Accepted" in system
      - Issue refund if not already provisioned by bank
      - Loss is absorbed
      - NOTE: High acceptance rate damages merchant account standing

   B. ISSUE REFUND (Pre-representment)
      When to refund:
      - Customer has valid complaint (should have been handled via SOP-003)
      - Item was defective/damaged but customer went straight to bank
      - We can resolve by refunding, avoiding chargeback on record

      Action:
      - Contact customer (if possible) to offer resolution
      - Issue refund through processor
      - Request customer withdraw chargeback with their bank
      - NOTE: If chargeback already provisioned by bank + we refund = customer has double refund
        → Must coordinate with bank to ensure only one refund

   C. DISPUTE THE CHARGEBACK (Representment)
      When to dispute:
      - We fulfilled order correctly (item shipped and delivered)
      - Customer received item and is committing friendly fraud
      - Processing error by payment processor (not our fault)
      - Customer failed to follow return policy

      Action:
      - Gather compelling evidence
      - Submit representment package within deadline
      - Wait for card issuer decision (30-60 days typically)

4. REPRESENTMENT: GATHERING EVIDENCE

   If disputing chargeback, compile evidence package:

   A. REQUIRED DOCUMENTS (all cases):
      - Original order confirmation (with date, items, amount)
      - Customer IP address and location at time of order
      - AVS (Address Verification System) results
      - CVV verification results
      - Shipping confirmation and tracking information
      - Delivery confirmation (signature if available)
      - Screenshots of relevant system records

   B. ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE BY REASON CODE:

      For FRAUD claims (customer says unauthorized):
      - Proof item shipped to cardholder's billing address
      - Device fingerprinting data
      - Customer's IP address matches previous legitimate orders
      - Customer account activity log (logged in, browsed, added to cart)
      - Correspondence with customer (if any)
      - Signature on delivery (strong evidence)

      For NOT RECEIVED claims:
      - Tracking showing "Delivered"
      - Delivery photo (if available from carrier)
      - Signature confirmation
      - Customer communications (if they contacted us, proves they knew about order)

      For NOT AS DESCRIBED claims:
      - Product description from website (screenshots)
      - Product photos we displayed
      - Customer reviews showing product as expected
      - Return policy clearly stated
      - Evidence item was not returned (if customer claims defective but didn't return)

   C. CUSTOMER COMMUNICATION HISTORY:
      - Did customer contact us first? (Best practice dictates they should)
      - Did we respond appropriately?
      - Did we offer resolution that customer declined?
      - Include full email thread or call logs

   D. POLICIES & TERMS:
      - Return policy customer agreed to
      - Terms of service
      - Refund policy
      - Clear statement customer violated policy by going to bank instead of us

5. SUBMIT REPRESENTMENT PACKAGE

   A. FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:
      - Combine all documents into single PDF
      - Each page labeled clearly (e.g., "Page 3: Delivery Confirmation")
      - Cover letter summarizing why chargeback should be reversed
      - Total package typically 8-15 pages
      - File size limit: 10MB (compress images if needed)

   B. SUBMISSION:
      - Upload to chargeback management portal
      - Submit BEFORE deadline (aim for 48 hours before)
      - Confirm submission receipt
      - Note submission date/time in tracking system

   C. COVER LETTER TEMPLATE (customize per case):
      ```
      RE: Chargeback Case [CASE NUMBER] - [CARDHOLDER NAME]

      To Whom It May Concern:

      We are disputing this chargeback for the following reasons:
      1. [Primary reason - e.g., "Item was delivered to cardholder's address on [DATE]"]
      2. [Supporting reason - e.g., "Delivery confirmed by tracking number [TRACKING]"]
      3. [Policy reason - e.g., "Cardholder did not attempt to resolve with merchant per Visa guidelines"]

      Please see attached evidence:
      - Exhibit A: Order confirmation
      - Exhibit B: Delivery confirmation
      - Exhibit C: [Additional evidence]

      We request this chargeback be reversed and funds returned to merchant account.

      Respectfully,
      [Company Name] Chargeback Team
      ```

6. AWAIT DECISION

   A. TIMELINE:
      - Card issuer reviews: 30-60 days (varies by network)
      - May request additional information (rare)
      - Decision: WIN or LOSE (no partial outcomes)

   B. WIN (Chargeback reversed):
      - Funds returned to our merchant account
      - Customer's provisional credit reversed by their bank
      - Case closed
      - Update internal records

   C. LOSE (Chargeback upheld):
      - Funds remain with customer
      - We absorb loss
      - Chargeback fee charged ($15-25 per chargeback)
      - Counts against merchant account chargeback ratio
      - Consider: Pre-arbitration (escalation to card network, high cost)

   D. PRE-ARBITRATION (Optional, rare):
      - If we lose but believe decision was wrong
      - Escalates to Visa/Mastercard arbitration
      - Costs $500-750 in fees
      - Only do if: Loss >$500, evidence is very strong
      - Requires VP approval

7. CUSTOMER COMMUNICATION (Tricky)

   A. IF CHARGEBACK RECEIVED:
      - System should flag customer account: "CHARGEBACK FILED"
      - If customer contacts us: Explain chargeback process
      - Cannot issue additional refund (they already have bank's provisional credit)
      - Inform them: "Your bank has issued you a credit. We are reviewing the case."

   B. DOUBLE REFUND RISK:
      - Customer files chargeback (bank provisions credit)
      - Customer also requests refund from us (double-dipping)
      - Before issuing refund, CHECK for open chargebacks
      - If chargeback exists: "Your bank has already issued a credit. We cannot refund twice."

   C. IF CUSTOMER WANTS TO WITHDRAW CHARGEBACK:
      - Customer may realize mistake, wants to withdraw
      - Direct them to contact their bank immediately
      - Bank must withdraw chargeback (customer cannot do it directly with us)
      - Withdrawal success rate: ~30% (many banks won't allow)
      - If withdrawn early: We avoid chargeback entirely (best outcome)

8. PREVENTION & PATTERN ANALYSIS

   A. TRACK CHARGEBACK METRICS:
      - Chargeback ratio: Chargebacks per 100 transactions
      - Industry average: 0.5-1.0%
      - Our target: <0.6%
      - Current: 0.8% (needs improvement)
      - WARNING: >1% ratio may trigger payment processor penalties

   B. ANALYZE PATTERNS:
      - Which products have high chargeback rates?
      - Which shipping methods? (slow shipping = more "not received" chargebacks)
      - Which customer segments? (new accounts, international, high-value)
      - Which reason codes most common?

   C. PREVENTION STRATEGIES:
      - Improve product descriptions (reduce "not as described")
      - Faster shipping (reduce "not received")
      - Better customer service (resolve before chargeback filed)
      - Fraud detection (prevent unauthorized transactions)
      - Clear policies (customers know what to expect)

9. DOCUMENTATION

   A. LOG EVERY CHARGEBACK:
      - Case number
      - Customer name and order number
      - Amount
      - Reason code
      - Response strategy (accept, refund, dispute)
      - Outcome (win/lose)
      - Financial impact

   B. MONTHLY CHARGEBACK REPORT:
      - Total chargebacks received
      - Total amount disputed
      - Win rate (target: >60%)
      - Chargeback ratio
      - Top reason codes
      - Trends and recommendations

EDGE CASES & EXCEPTIONS:

A) CHARGEBACK ON REFUNDED TRANSACTION
   - Customer requested refund, we processed it
   - But customer ALSO filed chargeback (impatient or error)
   - Evidence: Show refund was processed before chargeback date
   - Outcome: Usually win (customer got refund, chargeback is duplicate)

B) CUSTOMER FILES MULTIPLE CHARGEBACKS
   - Same customer disputes multiple transactions
   - May indicate serial friendly fraud
   - Flag account: "Multiple chargebacks - potential fraudster"
   - Consider banning customer (requires Legal approval)
   - Report to fraud prevention networks

C) CHARGEBACK ON SUBSCRIPTION PAYMENT
   - Customer disputes recurring subscription charge
   - Evidence needed: Proof customer agreed to recurring billing
   - Include: Original subscription terms, renewal notifications sent
   - Common outcome: We win if we can prove proper notification

D) INTERNATIONAL CHARGEBACKS
   - Card issued in foreign country
   - Different rules may apply
   - Currency conversion may cause amount confusion
   - Timeline may be longer (up to 90 days)
   - Language barriers in documentation

E) CHARGEBACK AFTER RETURN
   - Customer returned item, refund in progress
   - Customer gets impatient, files chargeback
   - Evidence: Show return was received, refund processing
   - Contact customer to withdraw chargeback

F) VERY OLD CHARGEBACKS (>90 days)
   - System may lack detailed records (migration gap)
   - Do best with available evidence
   - If insufficient evidence: Accept loss (cost-benefit)

SYSTEM LIMITATIONS:
- Payment processor system integration incomplete (some manual data entry required)
- Historical transaction data >90 days may be incomplete
- Shipping tracking links expire after 120 days (screenshot early)
- Customer IP logs retained 60 days only
- Chargeback response system doesn't support videos (only PDFs, images)

- Legal: Handles complex disputes, arbitration
- IT: Provides technical evidence (IP logs, device fingerprinting)
- Warehouse: Confirms shipping and delivery details

FINANCIAL IMPACT:
- Average chargeback: $200-300
- Chargeback fee: $15-25 per case (regardless of outcome)
- Win rate: Currently 58% (industry average 40-60%)
- Monthly chargeback losses: ~$8K
- Prevention efforts have saved ~$15K over past year

RELATED SOPS:
- SOP-003: Billing Disputes (handle before it becomes chargeback)
- SOP-007: Fraud Prevention (prevent unauthorized transactions)
- SOP-001: Standard Returns (proper refund process customers should use)

NOTES:
- Chargebacks are lose-lose: Customer banks penalize us, we lose time/money fighting
- Best strategy: Prevent chargebacks by excellent customer service
- When customer contacts with issue: Resolve immediately (prevents chargeback filing)
- "Friendly fraud" (customer files chargeback instead of return) is 60-70% of our chargebacks
- Education: Some customers don't realize chargeback is "nuclear option"
- High chargeback ratio can result in: Higher processing fees, merchant account termination
- Payment processor reviews our account quarterly - chargeback ratio is key metric

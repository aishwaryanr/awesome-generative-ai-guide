SOP-003: Billing Disputes & Duplicate Charges
Version: 2.3
Last Updated: 2025-01-20
Department: Customer Support / Finance
---

PURPOSE:
Investigate and resolve billing issues including duplicate charges, incorrect amounts, unauthorized charges, and refund delays.

SCOPE:
Covers all billing-related disputes for orders placed within 90 days. Older disputes require Finance team review. Does not cover chargebacks filed with banks (see SOP-015).

PREREQUISITES:
- Access to billing system (requires elevated permissions)
- Customer identity verified (security questions OR order confirmation code)
- Original transaction must be visible in system

PROCEDURE:

1. INITIAL VERIFICATION & TRIAGE
   a. Verify customer identity:
      - Email address matches account
      - Can provide order number OR last 4 digits of payment method
      - If verification fails: Cannot proceed (security policy)
        → Advise customer to contact from registered email

   b. Identify dispute type:
      - DUPLICATE CHARGE: Same amount charged multiple times
      - INCORRECT AMOUNT: Charge different from order total
      - UNAUTHORIZED CHARGE: Customer claims didn't place order
      - REFUND NOT RECEIVED: Previous refund not showing in account
      - SUBSCRIPTION ISSUE: Recurring charge customer wants cancelled

   c. Check dispute history:
      - Has customer disputed charges before? (fraud flag if >3 times in 6 months)
      - Are multiple customers reporting issues with same transaction date?
        → May indicate payment processor outage or batch error

2. INVESTIGATE THE CHARGE

   A. DUPLICATE CHARGES
      - Check transaction log:
        * Was order submitted multiple times? (common: customer clicked "Pay" multiple times)
        * System error? (payment gateway timeout causing double processing)
        * Separate orders? (cart reopened, placed second order)

      - Verify charge status:
        * Both charges "settled" (fully processed)
        * One "settled", one "pending" (may auto-cancel in 3-5 days)
        * One "settled", one "pre-authorization hold" (NOT actual charge, will drop off)

      - IMPORTANT: Pre-authorization holds look like charges but aren't
        → Show as "pending" in customer's bank
        → Drop off in 3-7 business days
        → We cannot "cancel" a hold, only bank can release
        → Common with gas station-style authorization

      Action based on findings:
      - Two actual charges: Refund duplicate immediately
      - One charge + one hold: Explain hold will drop, no action needed (but offer goodwill credit)
      - Two separate orders: Explain both valid, offer to cancel/return one if desired

   B. INCORRECT AMOUNT CHARGED
      - Compare:
        * Order total shown in confirmation email
        * Amount actually charged
        * Cart contents at checkout

      - Common causes:
        * Tax calculation error (wrong state/region detected)
        * Shipping cost added but not shown properly
        * Discount code not applied
        * Currency conversion (international orders)
        * Tip added on mobile (some mobile browsers have tip prompts)

      - Calculate correct amount:
        Items: $XXX
        Shipping: $XXX
        Tax: $XXX
        Discount: -$XXX
        TOTAL: $XXX

      - If we overcharged: Refund difference immediately
      - If we undercharged:
        * Our error: Customer keeps discount (goodwill)
        * If amount >$50 undercharged: Finance must approve (may request additional payment)

   C. UNAUTHORIZED CHARGES / FRAUD
      - HIGH PRIORITY - potential account compromise

      - Interview customer:
        * Do they recognize the shipping address?
        * Do they live with anyone who may have ordered?
        * Have they shared account access with family?
        * Was their payment method stolen/compromised?

      - Check order details:
        * Shipped to customer's registered address: Likely legitimate
        * Shipped elsewhere: Possible fraud
        * Digital items (gift cards, downloads): High fraud risk

      - Check account activity:
        * Recent password changes?
        * Login from unusual location/IP?
        * Shipping address added recently?

      Action based on fraud assessment:
      - LOW RISK (probably legitimate, customer forgot):
        → Explain order details, offer return option
      - MEDIUM RISK (unclear):
        → Supervisor review required
      - HIGH RISK (likely fraudulent):
        → Cancel order if not shipped
        → If shipped, intercept package (contact warehouse)
        → Issue refund
        → Reset account password
        → Place account security hold (additional verification required for future orders)
        → Report to Fraud Prevention team

   D. REFUND NOT RECEIVED
      - Locate original refund transaction:
        * Check refund date in system
        * Refund method (original payment method vs store credit)
        * Refund status: Processed, Pending, Failed

      - Timeline expectations:
        * Credit card: 5-7 business days after processing
        * Debit card: 3-5 business days
        * PayPal: 1-3 business days
        * Bank transfer: 7-10 business days
        * Check by mail: 10-14 business days

      - Common issues:
        * Refund processed, but within normal timeframe (customer checking too soon)
        * Refunded to expired/closed card (bank should redirect to new card, but sometimes fails)
        * Refunded to wrong payment method (customer used multiple cards, we refunded to original but they're checking different card)
        * Refund failed (payment processor rejected it)

      - If refund shows "Failed" in system:
        * Contact Finance team to investigate
        * May need to issue refund via alternative method (check, bank transfer)
        * Requires 3-5 business days for Finance review

3. RESOLUTION & PROCESSING

   a. Immediate refund authority:
      - Amounts <$200: Agent can process immediately
      - Amounts $200-$500: Supervisor approval required (usually granted same day)
      - Amounts >$500: Finance team approval (may take 1-2 business days)

   b. Issue refund:
      - System button: "Issue Refund"
      - Select reason code (required for reporting):
        * DUPLICATE_CHARGE
        * OVERCHARGE_ERROR
        * FRAUD_PROTECTION
        * CUSTOMER_DISPUTE_OTHER

      - Refund to:
        * Original payment method (default)
        * Alternative method if original unavailable:
          → Store credit (instant)
          → Check by mail (10-14 days)
          → Bank transfer (3-5 days, requires bank details)

   c. Document resolution:
      - Case notes must include:
        * Dispute type
        * Investigation findings
        * Refund amount and method
        * Customer notified? (Y/N)
        * Any fraud indicators? (Y/N)

4. CUSTOMER COMMUNICATION
   - Acknowledge dispute within 4 hours
   - Set expectations:
     * Investigation may take 24-48 hours for complex cases
     * Refund processing time (varies by method)
     * Next steps if refund doesn't appear

   - Use templates:
     * CS-BL-001: Dispute Acknowledgment
     * CS-BL-003: Duplicate Charge Resolution
     * CS-BL-005: Refund Processed Confirmation

   - For pre-authorization holds:
     * Explain clearly this is NOT a charge
     * Cannot be cancelled by us
     * Will auto-release in 3-7 days
     * Provide link to article explaining holds

5. FOLLOW-UP & PREVENTION
   - Follow up 7-10 days after resolution:
     * "Did your refund appear?"
     * "Were you satisfied with resolution?"

   - Log issue for trend analysis:
     * Multiple duplicate charges on same day: Payment processor issue
     * Multiple disputes from same payment method: Possible fraud ring
     * Pattern of overcharges: Tax calculation bug

EDGE CASES & EXCEPTIONS:

A) CHARGEBACK FILED WITH BANK
   - Customer went directly to bank and filed dispute
   - Bank has already reversed charge
   - We receive chargeback notification
   - IMMEDIATELY escalate to Chargeback team (SOP-015)
   - DO NOT issue additional refund (customer already has money back)
   - If we also refund, customer has double refund (must recover one)

B) INTERNATIONAL CURRENCY ISSUES
   - Customer charged in USD but expected local currency (or vice versa)
   - Exchange rate fluctuations between order and charge
   - Currency conversion fees added by bank (not our charge)
   - Solution: Explain breakdown, refund if our error in currency selection

C) SUBSCRIPTION CANCELLATION REQUESTS
   - Customer wants to cancel recurring subscription
   - Check subscription status:
     * Active: Can cancel, refund current period (prorated)
     * Already cancelled: Confirm cancellation date, explain final charge
     * Paused: Explain pause status, offer to fully cancel

   - Subscription refund policy:
     * Cancel before renewal date: No charge, no refund needed
     * Cancel after renewal: Refund full amount (customer-friendly policy)
     * Note: Changed in 2024, old policy was no refunds - be aware when reviewing old cases

D) PAYMENT METHOD EXPIRED/CHANGED
   - Cannot refund to expired card
   - Options:
     * New card from same bank: Often auto-routes to new card
     * Different payment method: Requires customer to provide new details
     * Store credit: Instant alternative
     * Check by mail: Backup option (slowest)

E) BATCH PROCESSING ERRORS
   - Occasionally, payment processor has batch error
   - Multiple customers charged incorrectly on same date
   - Finance team issues mass refund
   - If customer contacts before mass refund processed:
     → Check internal alerts for batch error notice
     → Explain proactive refund in progress
     → Avoid processing duplicate refund

F) PARTIAL CHARGES (MULTIPLE ITEMS)
   - Order has 3 items, customer disputes charge for 1 item
   - Cannot refund single item from multi-item charge
   - Options:
     * Process full refund, customer reorders other items
     * Process partial refund (manual Finance team request)
     * Offer store credit for disputed item value

SYSTEM LIMITATIONS:
- Refund system only processes M-F (no weekend processing)
- Maximum refund per transaction: $10,000 (higher amounts require wire transfer)
- Payment gateway logs retained 90 days only
  → Disputes >90 days: Must request from Finance archives (2-3 day wait)
- Some payment methods don't support refunds (prepaid cards, gift cards)
  → Offer store credit instead

ESCALATION CRITERIA:
- Amount >$500: Supervisor approval needed
- Suspected fraud: Fraud Prevention team
- Chargeback filed: Chargeback team (DO NOT handle in regular support)
- Customer threatens legal action: Legal Compliance team
- Refund failed/rejected by processor: Finance team
- Customer dissatisfied after 2 attempts: Escalate to support manager

FRAUD INDICATORS (escalate immediately):
- Multiple disputes from same customer in short timeframe
- Dispute claims "unauthorized" but order shipped to customer's address
- Customer unable to verify basic account details
- IP address shows different country than billing address
- High-value orders with free email domain (gmail, yahoo) + new account
- Multiple payment methods attempted before successful charge

RELATED SOPS:
- SOP-001: Standard Returns (if customer wants to return item AND get refund)
- SOP-007: Account Security & Compromise
- SOP-015: Chargeback Management
- SOP-018: Subscription Cancellations

NOTES:
- Be empathetic - billing issues cause stress and distrust
- Assume customer is telling truth unless clear fraud indicators
- When in doubt, favor customer (within reason) - cost of goodwill < cost of lost customer
- Peak periods (Black Friday, holidays): Higher volume of billing errors due to system strain

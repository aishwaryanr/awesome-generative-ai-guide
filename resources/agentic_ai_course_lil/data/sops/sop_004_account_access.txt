SOP-004: Account Access Issues & Password Resets
Version: 1.5
Last Updated: 2025-01-18
Department: Customer Support / IT Security
---

PURPOSE:
Assist customers who cannot access their accounts due to forgotten passwords, locked accounts, email access issues, or other authentication problems.

SCOPE:
Covers account access issues for customer-facing accounts. Does not cover employee accounts (IT Helpdesk) or business/wholesale accounts (B2B Support).

PREREQUISITES:
- Customer must verify identity before any account changes
- Cannot reset password for customer - they must do it themselves via secure link
- Some actions require IT Security approval

PROCEDURE:

1. IDENTIFY THE ACCESS ISSUE

   a. Ask customer to describe problem:
      - "Forgot password" (most common)
      - "Account locked" (after multiple failed login attempts)
      - "Email not recognized" (typo or different email)
      - "Can't receive password reset email"
      - "Account hacked/compromised"
      - "Two-factor authentication (2FA) issues"

   b. Check account status in system:
      - Active
      - Locked (security lock after failed attempts)
      - Suspended (fraud flag or payment issue)
      - Closed (customer or system closed account)
      - Merged (duplicate account merged into another)

2. VERIFY CUSTOMER IDENTITY

   SECURITY CRITICAL: Never reset or modify account without proper verification

   a. Primary verification methods:
      - Can access registered email: Send verification code (6-digit)
      - Can access phone (if on file): Send SMS verification code
      - Can provide recent order number + billing zip code
      - Can answer security questions (if set up)

   b. If primary methods fail:
      - Last 4 digits of payment method on file
      - Shipping address on last order
      - Approximate date of last order
      - Items purchased (last 3 orders)

   c. If still cannot verify:
      - Escalate to IT Security team
      - May require photo ID submission via secure upload portal
      - Process takes 24-48 hours

   IMPORTANT: If verification fails after 3 attempts:
   → Cannot proceed (security policy)
   → Customer must use password reset flow independently
   → Do not override security measures

3. RESOLUTION BY ISSUE TYPE

   A. FORGOT PASSWORD (Email accessible)
      - Customer must use self-service password reset:
        * Go to login page
        * Click "Forgot Password"
        * Enter email address
        * Check email for reset link (expires in 1 hour)
        * Create new password

      - If reset email not arriving:
        * Check spam/junk folder
        * Verify correct email address (common: typos in email)
        * Check if email provider blocking our domain (rare)
          → Add support@[company].com to contacts, try again
        * System delay (emails can take 5-10 minutes during peak)

      - If email definitely not arriving after 15 minutes:
        * Try alternative verification (phone SMS)
        * Or escalate to IT to check email delivery logs
        * May be issue with specific email provider (AOL, older ISPs sometimes problematic)

   B. ACCOUNT LOCKED (Failed Login Attempts)
      - Auto-locks after 5 failed password attempts
      - Security measure to prevent brute-force attacks
      - Unlocks automatically after 30 minutes
      - OR customer can use "Forgot Password" immediately (bypasses lock)

      - If customer needs immediate access:
        * Option 1: Wait 30 minutes
        * Option 2: Reset password now (recommended)

      - If locked due to suspicious activity (not just wrong password):
        * System may extend lock to 24 hours
        * Customer sees message: "Account temporarily locked for security review"
        * Must escalate to IT Security - agent cannot unlock
        * IT reviews: 4-6 hours during business hours, up to 24 hours on weekends

   C. EMAIL NOT RECOGNIZED
      - Common issue: Customer has multiple emails, can't remember which one
      - Search by:
        * Name + zip code
        * Phone number (if provided)
        * Order number (if available)

      - If account found with different email:
        * Inform customer of correct email (but read it back obscured for security):
          "Your account is registered with j***@g***.com - do you recognize this?"
        * Customer must access that email for password reset

      - If account NOT found:
        * Customer may not have created account (guest checkout)
        * Or account deleted/merged
        * Check "Deleted Accounts" table (requires supervisor access)
        * If deleted: Can reactivate within 60 days (after that, permanently deleted)

   D. CAN'T RECEIVE PASSWORD RESET EMAIL
      - Email delivery issues more common than system issues

      - Troubleshooting steps:
        1. Confirm correct email (have customer spell it out)
        2. Check spam/junk folder
        3. Check email filters/rules blocking our domain
        4. Try sending to alternative email (if on file)
        5. Check if email inbox full (less common now)
        6. Provider-specific issues:
           * AOL, Yahoo: Sometimes delayed 15-30 minutes
           * Corporate emails: IT may block external links
           * School emails (.edu): Often have aggressive spam filters

      - If none work:
        * Use SMS phone verification (if phone on file)
        * If no phone: Security questions
        * If none available: Escalate to IT + require ID verification

   E. ACCOUNT HACKED / COMPROMISED
      - HIGH PRIORITY - potential fraud

      - Indicators of compromise:
        * Orders placed customer didn't make
        * Shipping address changed
        * Payment method added/changed
        * Email address changed
        * Password recently changed (but not by customer)

      - IMMEDIATE actions:
        1. Place security hold on account (prevent new orders)
        2. Force password reset
        3. Remove any suspicious payment methods
        4. Remove any suspicious shipping addresses
        5. Cancel any pending orders (if shipped, attempt intercept)
        6. Notify IT Security team

      - Investigation:
        * Check account activity log:
          - Recent logins (IP addresses, locations, devices)
          - Recent changes (email, password, payment, address)
        * Check order history for unauthorized orders
        * Review payment disputes (chargebacks filed?)

      - Resolution:
        * Reset all account credentials
        * Enable 2FA (mandatory for compromised accounts)
        * Issue refunds for unauthorized orders
        * Provide incident report to customer
        * Timeline: 1-2 business days for full resolution

   F. TWO-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION (2FA) ISSUES
      - Customer enabled 2FA, now can't receive codes

      - Scenarios:
        a) Phone number changed/lost:
           * Use backup codes (if customer saved them)
           * If no backup codes: Must verify identity, then IT removes 2FA
           * Re-enable 2FA with new phone number

        b) 2FA app deleted/phone replaced:
           * Similar to above
           * Must verify identity, IT removes 2FA
           * Customer re-enables with new device

        c) Codes not working (wrong time sync):
           * 2FA codes time-sensitive
           * Check device clock - must be accurate
           * Common issue: Phone set to wrong timezone

        d) Never set up 2FA but system asking for it:
           * May be enabled by mistake
           * Or security measure after suspicious activity
           * Verify identity, then IT can adjust

4. DOCUMENTATION
   - Log in system:
     * Issue type (dropdown)
     * Verification method used
     * Resolution provided
     * Any security flags noted

   - If security incident:
     * Create separate incident report
     * Notify IT Security AND customer
     * Document timeline of events

5. CUSTOMER COMMUNICATION
   - Be patient - authentication issues frustrating
   - Use simple language (avoid tech jargon)
   - Provide step-by-step instructions
   - Acknowledge security measures may be inconvenient but protect their account

   - Templates:
     * CS-ACC-001: Password Reset Instructions
     * CS-ACC-003: Account Locked Notification
     * CS-ACC-005: Security Incident Notification

6. FOLLOW-UP
   - For security incidents: Follow up 24 hours after resolution
   - For standard password resets: No follow-up needed
   - If customer expressed frustration: Personal follow-up email from manager

EDGE CASES & EXCEPTIONS:

A) DECEASED ACCOUNT HOLDER
   - Family member trying to access deceased person's account
   - CANNOT provide access without legal documentation
   - Require:
     * Death certificate
     * Proof of legal authority (executor of estate, etc.)
   - Escalate to Legal team
   - Process takes 5-10 business days

B) ACCOUNT UNDER 13 YEARS OLD
   - COPPA compliance issue
   - Accounts for children <13 require parental consent
   - If discovered:
     * Suspend account immediately
     * Request parental verification
     * Or close account and refund orders
   - Notify Legal Compliance

C) BUSINESS ACCOUNT vs PERSONAL
   - Sometimes business owner trying to access personal account settings
   - Business accounts managed differently (B2B portal)
   - Cannot merge business and personal accounts
   - Must use separate logins

D) INTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTS WITH PHONE VERIFICATION
   - SMS codes to international numbers sometimes fail
   - Higher cost for company to send international SMS
   - Prefer email verification for international customers
   - If SMS required: May take 15-30 minutes to arrive

E) ACCOUNT MERGED DUE TO DUPLICATE
   - Customer had 2 accounts with different emails
   - System auto-merged to primary account
   - Customer trying to access old email/account
   - Explain merge, provide primary account details
   - Order history combined in primary account

F) CORPORATE EMAIL BLOCKS RESET LINKS
   - Corporate IT often blocks password reset links (security policy)
   - Customer must:
     * Update account with personal email OR
     * Contact their IT to whitelist our domain OR
     * Use phone verification instead

SYSTEM LIMITATIONS:
- Password reset links expire after 1 hour (cannot extend)
- Account lockout timer cannot be manually overridden (30-min fixed)
- SMS verification: Some countries not supported (Cuba, North Korea, Syria)
- Email delivery: Not instant (can take 1-10 minutes)
- 2FA backup codes: Only generated once (if lost, must remove 2FA)

ESCALATION CRITERIA:
- Cannot verify identity after 3 attempts: Security team
- Account compromise suspected: IT Security (immediate)
- Account locked >24 hours: IT Support
- Need to access deleted account: Database team + supervisor
- Legal documentation required: Legal team
- Customer threatening legal action: Legal Compliance

SECURITY RED FLAGS (escalate immediately):
- Customer knows order details but fails basic verification
- Multiple people calling about same account
- Requests to change email/phone without proper verification
- Pressuring agent to bypass security measures
- Account has recent suspicious activity + access request

RELATED SOPS:
- SOP-007: Account Security & Fraud Prevention
- SOP-003: Billing Disputes (if compromised account used for fraud)
- SOP-014: Privacy & Data Requests (if customer wants account data)

NOTES:
- Security vs convenience tradeoff: Always favor security
- Cannot "just help customer out" by bypassing verification - termination offense
- Document every verification attempt and method used
- If uncertain about security: Escalate rather than risk compromise
- Remember: Account access = access to payment methods, order history, personal info

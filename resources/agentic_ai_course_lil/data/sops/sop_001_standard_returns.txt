Version: 2.1
Last Updated: 2025-01-15
Department: Customer Support
---

PURPOSE:
Process customer return requests for items purchased within the return window, ensuring consistent handling and customer satisfaction.

SCOPE:
Applies to all non-final-sale items purchased within 30 days. Does not cover damaged items (see SOP-002) or wrong item shipments (see SOP-006).

PREREQUISITES:
- Customer account must be accessible in system
- Order details must be available
- NOTE: If order is older than 90 days, historical data may be incomplete in new system (migration gap)

PROCEDURE:

1. VERIFY CUSTOMER & ORDER
   a. Locate customer account using email or order number
   b. Confirm order date and items purchased
   c. Check if order was placed before 2024-03-15 (old system):
      - If YES: Historical order data may be limited. Proceed with available information.
      - If NO: Full order history available.

2. CHECK RETURN ELIGIBILITY
   a. Calculate days since delivery (use delivery date, NOT order date)
   b. Within 30 days of delivery?
      - YES: Proceed to step 3
      - NO: Check if customer has Premium account
        * Premium: Extended 60-day return window → Proceed to step 3
        * Regular: Outside return window → Offer store credit (50% value) OR escalate to supervisor for exception

   c. Check item condition requirements:
      - Must be unworn/unused
      - Original packaging preferred but not required
      - Tags attached (clothing only)

   d. Final sale items (clearance marked >70% off):
      - NOT eligible for return
      - Can only offer store credit as goodwill gesture (requires supervisor approval)

3. ISSUE RETURN AUTHORIZATION
   a. Generate RMA (Return Merchandise Authorization) number
      - Format: RMA-YYYYMMDD-XXXXX
      - System generates automatically IF customer account linked
      - If guest checkout (no account): Manually create RMA in "Guest Returns" sheet

   b. Send return instructions email (Template: CS-RT-001)
      - RMA number
      - Return shipping label (if eligible, see below)
      - Packaging instructions
      - Timeline expectations (5-7 business days after receipt)

   c. FREE return shipping eligibility:
      - Order value >$50: Free prepaid label
      - Order value <$50: Customer pays return shipping UNLESS:
        * Premium account: Always free
        * Item was defective: Always free (but should use SOP-002 instead)
        * Our error (wrong item sent): Always free (but should use SOP-006 instead)

4. AWAIT PRODUCT RECEIPT
   - Expected timeline: 7-10 business days
   - Track using RMA number
   - NOTE: Warehouse processes returns M-F only (no weekend processing)

5. WAREHOUSE INSPECTION
   - Warehouse team inspects within 2 business days of receipt
   - Possible outcomes:
     a) Approved - Item in acceptable condition
     b) Partial approval - Minor damage (customer notified, offered partial refund)
     c) Rejected - Item used/damaged beyond policy

   - IMPORTANT: Inspection results sometimes delayed if returned to wrong facility
     (we have 2 warehouses; items may need internal transfer)

6. PROCESS REFUND
   a. Full refund approved:
      - Refund to original payment method
      - Processing time: 3-5 business days
      - Customer charged for return shipping if applicable (deducted from refund)

   b. Partial refund (damaged during return):
      - Supervisor determines refund percentage
      - Call customer to explain BEFORE processing
      - Get verbal confirmation

   c. Refund rejected:
      - Item returned to customer at their expense
      - OR offer to dispose of item (customer must confirm in writing)

7. CUSTOMER NOTIFICATION

     * Customer used our prepaid label: We absorb cost, process refund
     * Customer used own shipping: Customer files claim with carrier
     * If tracking shows "delivered" but warehouse never received:
       → Escalate to Warehouse Manager AND Customer Service Lead

SOP-010: Manufacturer Warranty Claims
Version: 1.7
Last Updated: 2025-01-21
Department: Customer Support / Product Support
---

PURPOSE:
Assist customers with manufacturer warranty claims for defective products outside our return window, facilitating resolution between customer and manufacturer while providing support throughout the process.

SCOPE:
Covers warranty claims on products >30 days after delivery (or >60 days for Premium accounts). For issues within return window, use SOP-002 instead. Applies to products with manufacturer warranties only (not all products have warranties).

PREREQUISITES:
- Product must have manufacturer warranty (check product details in system)
- Customer must have proof of purchase (order confirmation)
- Defect must be covered under warranty terms
- Product must be within warranty period (varies by manufacturer: 90 days to lifetime)

PROCEDURE:

1. DETERMINE IF WARRANTY APPLIES

   A. CHECK PRODUCT WARRANTY STATUS:
      - Search product SKU in system
      - View "Warranty Information" field:
        * "Manufacturer: 1-year limited warranty"
        * "Manufacturer: 90-day defect warranty"
        * "Manufacturer: Lifetime warranty"
        * "No manufacturer warranty" (typically: consumables, accessories, final sale items)

   B. CALCULATE DAYS SINCE PURCHASE:
      - Use delivery date (not order date)
      - Example: Product delivered Jan 15, today is April 20 → 95 days
      - Within our return window? (30/60 days)
        → YES: Use SOP-002 (we handle directly)
        → NO: Proceed with manufacturer warranty

   C. VERIFY DEFECT TYPE IS COVERED:
      Most warranties cover:
      - Manufacturing defects (faulty components, poor assembly)
      - Premature failure (product stops working under normal use)
      - Performance issues (doesn't perform as specified)

      Most warranties DO NOT cover:
      - Physical damage (dropped, liquid damage, impact)
      - Normal wear and tear (battery degradation, cosmetic aging)
      - Misuse or abuse (used outside intended purpose)
      - Unauthorized modifications (customer took apart, modified)
      - Consumable parts (batteries, filters, etc. have separate shorter warranties)

   D. IDENTIFY WARRANTY DURATION:
      Common warranty periods by product category:
      - Electronics: 1 year standard (some 2-3 years)
      - Appliances: 1-2 years
      - Furniture: 1-5 years (varies widely)
      - Tools: 90 days to lifetime (depending on brand)
      - Clothing/Shoes: 30-90 days (limited)
      - Kitchen items: 1 year typical

      NOTE: Extended warranties (purchased separately) tracked in different system
      → If customer has extended warranty: Route to Extended Warranty dept (SOP-019)

   - We can only provide proof of purchase; customer must work with manufacturer on region issues

D) MANUFACTURER OUT OF BUSINESS
   - Company went bankrupt or ceased operations
   - Warranty effectively void (no one to honor it)
   - Check for: Was brand acquired by another company? (may honor warranties)

   - Warranty applies per-item (not bundle as whole)
   - Handle defective item warranty separately

SYSTEM LIMITATIONS:

- Manufacturer contact info sometimes outdated (companies change, merge)
- Serial number verification: We can't always verify if serial number is valid
- Facilitated Warranty Program limited to ~30 major manufacturers
- Manufacturer portal logins: Some expire and require re-credentialing

MANUFACTURER RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT:
- We buy products from manufacturers/distributors
- Good relationship = better warranty support for our customers
- Quarterly reviews with major manufacturers:
  * Warranty claim volume
  * Denial rates
  * Customer satisfaction
  * Turnaround times
- Manufacturers with poor warranty support may be deprioritized in future purchasing

ESCALATION CRITERIA:

NOTES:
- Warranty support is value-add (builds customer loyalty even when product fails)

- Manufacturer warranty quality influences customer perception of us
- Clear communication prevents customer frustration with slow manufacturer processes
- Some manufacturers improving: Digital portals, advanced replacements, better communication

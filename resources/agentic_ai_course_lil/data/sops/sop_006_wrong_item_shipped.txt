SOP-006: Wrong Item Shipped
Version: 1.9
Last Updated: 2025-01-22
Department: Customer Support / Warehouse Operations
---

PURPOSE:
Handle situations where customers received an item different from what they ordered, providing swift resolution while investigating root cause to prevent recurrence.

SCOPE:
Covers all cases where shipped item does not match order (wrong SKU, wrong color/size variant, completely different product). Does not cover damaged items (SOP-002) or missing items (SOP-009).

PREREQUISITES:
- Customer must have order confirmation
- Customer must be able to describe/photograph received item
- Warehouse picking system must be accessible for investigation

PROCEDURE:

1. VERIFY THE ERROR
   a. Confirm what customer ordered:
      - Review original order details
      - Check item SKU, description, variant (color/size)
      - Verify order confirmation email matches system

   b. Confirm what customer received:
      - Request photo of received item (especially product label/barcode)
      - Request photo of shipping label on box
      - Request photo of packing slip (if included)
      - If customer can't provide photos: Detailed description including any visible SKU/model numbers

   c. Check if this is truly "wrong item":
      - WRONG ITEM: Ordered blue shirt, received red shirt
      - WRONG ITEM: Ordered phone case, received screen protector
      - NOT wrong item: Ordered "mystery box", contents vary (customer misunderstood product)
      - NOT wrong item: Ordered product but doesn't like it (this is standard return, SOP-001)

2. CLASSIFY ERROR TYPE

   For internal tracking and root cause analysis:

   A. VARIANT ERROR (most common ~45% of cases)
      - Correct product, wrong variant (color/size/model)
      - Example: Ordered Large, received Medium
      - Cause: Usually warehouse pick error or mislabeled inventory

   B. SIMILAR PRODUCT ERROR (~30%)
      - Wrong product but similar category
      - Example: Ordered iPhone 15 case, received iPhone 14 case
      - Cause: Look-alike packaging, adjacent warehouse bins

   C. COMPLETELY WRONG ITEM (~20%)
      - Totally different product category
      - Example: Ordered book, received kitchen utensil
      - Cause: Major pick error, barcode scan malfunction, or packing station mix-up

   D. MULTI-ITEM ORDER PARTIAL ERROR (~5%)
      - Ordered 3 items, 1 is wrong, other 2 correct
      - Requires special handling (can't return entire order)

3. INVESTIGATE ROOT CAUSE (simultaneous with resolution)

   a. Check warehouse pick history:
      - View pick ticket for order
      - Which warehouse location did we pick from?
      - Who picked the order? (for training, not blame)
      - What time? (rush period errors more common)

   b. Check inventory accuracy:
      - Is wrong item in same bin as correct item? (common cause)
      - Are items visually similar? (look-alike packaging)
      - Recent inventory relocation? (bins reassigned incorrectly)
      - Check if barcode in system matches physical barcode

   c. Flag for Quality Control if:
      - >3 reports of same error in 7 days (systematic issue)
      - High-value item error (>$200)
      - Safety-sensitive item (medical, baby products, food)

   IMPORTANT: Customer shouldn't wait for investigation
   → Resolve immediately, investigate in parallel

4. OFFER RESOLUTION OPTIONS

   a. Primary option - RESHIP CORRECT ITEM + KEEP WRONG ITEM:
      - Ship correct item immediately (expedited 2-day shipping)
      - Customer keeps wrong item (no return needed IF value <$50)
      - Why: Cheaper than return shipping + processing
      - Goodwill gesture that delights customer

   b. If wrong item value >$50:
      - Ship correct item (expedited)
      - Request return of wrong item (we provide prepaid label)
      - Customer can use wrong item until correct item arrives
      - Must return wrong item within 21 days

   c. If correct item out of stock:
      - Option 1: Ship when restocked + discount code (15% off)
      - Option 2: Full refund immediately
      - Option 3: Alternative product (similar specs, customer approval required)
      - Let customer choose - do NOT assume which they prefer

   d. Multi-item order with partial error:
      - Ship correct version of wrong item
      - Customer returns wrong item using provided label
      - Do NOT require return of entire order

5. PROCESS RESHIP

   a. Create reship order:
      - Mark as "PRIORITY - WRONG ITEM RESHIP" in system
      - Use expedited shipping (2-day) at no charge
      - Warehouse alert: "QC CHECK - Verify SKU before packing"
      - Send tracking info immediately when shipped

   b. If return required:
      - Generate return label (Template: WI-RETURN-002)
      - RMA format: WIS-YYYYMMDD-XXXXX
      - Timeline: Customer has 21 days (more generous than standard 14)
      - NOT strictly enforced - we caused the error

   c. Process refund if customer chose that option:
      - Full refund including original shipping
      - Expedited processing (within 24 hours)
      - 3-5 business days to payment method

6. SPECIAL HANDLING SCENARIOS

   A. CUSTOMER RECEIVED HIGH-VALUE ITEM BY MISTAKE
      - Example: Ordered $50 item, received $500 item
      - We MUST request return (cannot let customer keep)
      - Provide prepaid return label (signature required)
      - Send correct item simultaneously (not held pending return)
      - If customer refuses return: Escalate to Legal Compliance

   B. CUSTOMER RECEIVED SOMEONE ELSE'S ORDER (wrong address label)
      - PRIVACY CONCERN: Packing slip may show other customer's info
      - Ask customer to:
        * NOT open other customer's order (privacy)
        * Return entire package using provided label
        * Destroy or black out any visible personal info
      - Simultaneously ship correct order
      - Notify other affected customer if their order was misrouted
      - Escalate to Privacy Officer if sensitive info exposed

      - Example: Customer ordered non-prescription item, received prescription item
      - IMMEDIATE escalation to Safety team
      - Coordinated retrieval (may require special carrier)
      - Do NOT ask customer to return via standard shipping

   D. CUSTOMER ALREADY USED/OPENED WRONG ITEM
      - If item value <$50: Let customer keep, send correct item
      - If item value >$50: Partial refund + send correct item
        (Cannot accept return of used item in many cases)
      - Supervisor determines partial refund amount

7. CUSTOMER COMMUNICATION

8. DOCUMENTATION & ANALYSIS

   a. Log in wrong item tracking system:
      - Order number
      - Ordered SKU vs Received SKU
      - Error classification (variant/similar/completely wrong)
      - Warehouse location implicated
      - Resolution provided
      - Root cause identified (if determined)

   b. Weekly trend analysis:
      - Are certain SKUs frequently confused?
      - Are certain warehouse bins problematic?
      - Are errors concentrated to specific times/shifts?
      - Share findings with Warehouse Operations Manager

   c. Follow-up survey (7 days after resolution):
      - "Did correct item arrive?"
      - "Were you satisfied with how we handled this?"
      - "Any suggestions for preventing this in future?"

EDGE CASES & EXCEPTIONS:

A) CUSTOMER CLAIMS WRONG ITEM BUT CAN'T PROVE IT
   - No photos, vague description
   - Customer may be confused about what they ordered
   - Options:
     * Review order confirmation with customer (sometimes they ordered wrong thing)
     * If customer insists: Believe customer (benefit of doubt)
     * If pattern of wrong-item claims from same customer (>3): Investigate for fraud
     * Flag account if suspected fraud (not customer service issue)

B) INTERNATIONAL SHIPMENTS
   - Return shipping extremely expensive
   - Customs complications
   - Usually: Full refund + customer keeps wrong item (regardless of value)
   - Reship correct item with customs declaration correction

C) WRONG ITEM HIGHER VALUE THAN ORDERED ITEM
   - Customer might be tempted to keep it
   - We must request return
   - Cannot charge difference (we made the error)
   - If customer refuses return: Legal escalation
   - Cannot cancel customer account without Legal approval

D) SEASONAL/DISCONTINUED ITEMS
   - Customer ordered item, we shipped wrong substitute
   - Sometimes warehouse substitutes out-of-stock items (NOT supposed to without approval)
   - This is a serious process violation
   - Escalate to Warehouse Manager immediately
   - Options: Find correct item, full refund, or approved alternative

E) CUSTOM/PERSONALIZED ITEMS
   - Wrong name engraved, wrong photo printed, etc.
   - Cannot resell, must be discarded
   - Customer always keeps wrong item (no return)
   - Rush production of correct personalized item
   - Significant goodwill gesture required (25% refund + correct item)

F) THIRD-PARTY SELLER ITEMS (Marketplace)
   - Items sold by third-party sellers on our platform
   - MUST route to third-party seller support (SOP-012)
   - We do NOT handle directly
   - Verify seller info: Field "Sold by: [Company Name]"
   - Exception: If seller unresponsive >48 hours, we step in

SYSTEM LIMITATIONS:
- Warehouse pick logs retained 60 days only (older investigations limited)
- Barcode scanner error rate: ~0.1% (low but not zero)
- Inventory bin accuracy: Target 99.5% (we're at 98.8% currently)
- Some legacy SKUs not in new system (migration gap, pre-2024)
- Photo upload limit: 10MB per image (customer may need to compress)
- Cannot always determine root cause (30% of cases remain "unknown")

WAREHOUSE PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS:
Based on wrong-item incident data, we've implemented:
- Look-alike product bins now separated by >10 feet
- Variant products (colors/sizes) use different bin sections
- Scan verification: Pick → Scan → Pack → Scan (2-step verification)
- High-value items (>$200) require supervisor verification
- Peak season: Double-checking protocol for expedited orders

FRAUD INDICATORS (escalate to Fraud Prevention):
- Customer claims wrong item but refuses to provide photos (>2 times)
- Customer wants to keep high-value wrong item + also get correct item
- Pattern of wrong-item claims (>3 in 6 months)
- Customer unable to describe wrong item details
- Wrong item claim on final-sale/clearance items (potential buyer's remorse fraud)

ESCALATION CRITERIA:
- High-value wrong item (>$500): Supervisor approval for resolution
- Safety/compliance issue (restricted products): Safety team immediately
- Privacy exposure (other customer's info visible): Privacy Officer
- Customer refuses return of high-value wrong item: Legal Compliance
- Suspected warehouse systematic issue (>5 same errors): Warehouse Ops Manager
- Customer dissatisfied after resolution: Support Manager

PREVENTION METRICS (tracked monthly):
- Wrong item rate: Target <0.5% of orders (currently 0.7%)
- Variant error rate: Target <0.3% (currently 0.4%)
- Repeat wrong-item errors (same SKUs): Track and address top 10

RELATED SOPS:
- SOP-001: Standard Returns (if customer wants to return correct item after all this)
- SOP-002: Damaged Items (sometimes wrong item ALSO damaged)
- SOP-009: Missing Items from Order
- SOP-012: Third-Party Seller Support
- SOP-016: Warehouse Quality Control

NOTES:
- Wrong item shipments are 100% our fault - be extra apologetic
- Goodwill gestures almost always warranted
- Fast resolution more important than investigating cause (do both, but prioritize customer)
- Peak seasons (Nov-Dec, Prime Day): Wrong item rate increases 30-40% (more volume, rushed picks)
- Customer satisfaction score for wrong-item cases: Target 85%+ (currently 82%)

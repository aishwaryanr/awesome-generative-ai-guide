Version: 1.8
Last Updated: 2025-01-10
Department: Customer Support
---

PURPOSE:
Handle customer reports of items received in damaged or defective condition, providing expedited resolution to maintain customer trust.

SCOPE:
Covers items damaged during shipping OR manufacturing defects discovered upon receipt. Does not cover damage caused by customer use (normal wear and tear).

PREREQUISITES:
- Customer must report damage within 14 days of delivery
- Photo evidence strongly recommended but not required
- Order must be locatable in system

PROCEDURE:

1. INITIAL ASSESSMENT
   a. Ask customer to describe the damage:
      - Packaging damage (box crushed, torn, wet)
      - Product damage (broken, scratched, missing parts)
      - Functional defect (doesn't work, malfunctions)

   b. Request photos if not already provided:
      - Photo of damaged packaging (if applicable)
      - Photo of damaged product
      - Photo of product label/serial number (electronics only)
      - NOTE: Some customers unable to provide photos (accessibility, tech issues)
        → If no photos after 2 requests: Proceed based on description

   c. Verify reporting timeline:
      - Within 14 days of delivery: Full resolution available
      - 15-30 days: Possible resolution (supervisor approval required)
      - >30 days: Likely manufacturing warranty issue, not shipping damage
        → Refer to manufacturer warranty process (SOP-010)

2. DOCUMENT THE ISSUE
   a. Create damage report in system:
      - Case Type: "Damaged on Arrival" OR "Defective Product"
      - Severity:
        * Minor: Cosmetic damage, fully functional (e.g., small scratch)
        * Major: Significant damage, partially functional
        * Critical: Unusable, safety concern, completely broken

   b. Check if this product has multiple damage reports:
      - System flag if >5 reports in 30 days for same SKU
      - If flagged: Notify Quality Assurance team
      - QA may issue recall or supplier investigation

   c. Record carrier information:
      - Which shipping carrier delivered?
      - Was package visibly damaged on delivery?
      - Did customer refuse delivery OR accept damaged package?

EDGE CASES & EXCEPTIONS:

A) CUSTOMER DAMAGED ITEM DURING ATTEMPTED RETURN
   - Original item was fine, customer trying to return, damaged it in return shipping
   - Different from "damaged on arrival"
   - Handled under SOP-001 (standard returns, possible partial refund)

B) MISSING PARTS vs DAMAGED
   - If item missing parts but not damaged:
     * First check if parts sold separately
     * Contact manufacturer for replacement parts (often free)
     * If parts unavailable: Full replacement or refund

C) COSMETIC DAMAGE ON FINAL SALE / CLEARANCE ITEMS
   - Final sale items sold "as-is"
   - BUT if damage not disclosed: Customer entitled to refund
   - If customer claims damage but item was marked "cosmetic damage" in listing:
     → Review original listing for damage disclosure
     → If disclosed: No refund
     → If not disclosed: Full refund

D) INTERNATIONAL SHIPMENTS
   - Higher damage rate (longer transit)
   - Replacement shipping costly
   - Usually offer refund instead of replacement
   - Customs may complicate returns

E) THIRD-PARTY SELLER ITEMS (Marketplace)
   - Items sold by third-party sellers on our platform
   - MUST route to third-party seller support (SOP-012)
   - We do NOT handle directly
   - Verify seller info in system: Field "Sold by: [Company Name]"

F) DAMAGED DURING DELIVERY (VISIBLE DAMAGE)
   - If customer reports package arrived visibly damaged:
     * Should have noted on delivery receipt OR refused package
     * If accepted damaged package: Still covered under this SOP
     * If refused package: Item returned to us, issue refund immediately

SYSTEM LIMITATIONS:
- Damage photo uploads: System has 10MB limit per photo
  → If customer has high-res photos: Ask for email instead
- Stock availability: System updates every 4 hours, not real-time
  → Item may show in-stock but actually unavailable
  → Confirm with warehouse before promising replacement
- Carrier claim system: Separate platform, manual entry required
  → Sometimes claims don't sync back to main system

ESCALATION CRITERIA:
- Damage caused safety concern: IMMEDIATE escalation to Safety team
- Customer threatens lawsuit: Escalate to Legal
- Repeated damage on same customer's orders (>3 in 6 months): Investigate for fraud
- High-value electronics (>$1000): Supervisor approval required
- Customer dissatisfied with resolution: Offer to escalate to supervisor

SPECIAL NOTES:
- Peak season (Nov-Dec): Damage rate increases 20-30% (more volume, rushed handling)
- Fragile items: Should have been marked "Fragile" in shipping
  → If not marked and damaged: Our error, always replace
- Gift items: If gift recipient reports damage, must contact gift sender for order details
  → Privacy concerns: Cannot share sender info without permission

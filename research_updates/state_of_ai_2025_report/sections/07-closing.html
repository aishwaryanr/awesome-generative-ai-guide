        <div class="slide slide-section">
            <p class="label purple">Final</p>
            <h2>What to Remember</h2>
        </div>
        
        <!-- SLIDE 74: Takeaway 1 -->
        <div class="slide slide-statement">
            <h2>AI will become standard infrastructure.</h2>
            <p class="small">Competitive advantage comes from how you use it, not whether you have it. The question isn't "are you using AI?" but "how well are you using AI?"</p>
        </div>
        
        <!-- SLIDE 75: Takeaway 2 -->
        <div class="slide slide-statement">
            <h2>Integration quality beats model selection.</h2>
            <p class="small">The best model poorly integrated loses to a good model well integrated. Invest in the plumbing. The unsexy infrastructure work is where the value is.</p>
        </div>
        
        <!-- SLIDE 76: Takeaway 3 -->
        <div class="slide slide-statement">
            <h2>Build evaluation, cost tracking, and safety into your stack now.</h2>
            <p class="small">Enterprises will require it. Production guarantees, SLAs, indemnification, predictable pricing:the age of experimentation gives way to operational discipline.</p>
        </div>
        
        <!-- SLIDE 77: Takeaway 4 -->
        <div class="slide slide-statement">
            <h2>Measure business outcomes, not AI capabilities.</h2>
            <p class="small">The most impressive deployments won't be the most technically sophisticated:they'll be the ones solving real problems for real users at sustainable costs.</p>
        </div>
        
        <!-- SLIDE 78: The Most Important Lesson -->
        <div class="slide slide-quote">
            <blockquote>"AI's value doesn't come from any single breakthrough but from making all the pieces work together."</blockquote>
            <p class="attr">The future belongs not to those with the best models, but to those who best integrate AI into the messy reality of human work.</p>
        </div>
        
        <!-- SLIDE 79: State of AI Summary -->
        <div class="slide slide-list">
            <h2>The State of Applied AI in 2025</h2>
            <ul>
                <li class="green"><strong>It works, mostly.</strong> Teams that shipped focused on narrow scope, human checkpoints, and boring reliability over impressive capabilities.</li>
                <li class="orange"><strong>It's expensive:but manageable.</strong> Cost optimization is a discipline now. Caching, quantization, and specialization make production viable.</li>
                <li class="purple"><strong>Most pilots fail.</strong> Not because AI doesn't work, but because integration, reliability, and cost weren't planned for.</li>
                <li class="blue"><strong>The foundations are solid.</strong> Standards like MCP exist. Patterns are documented. The wild experimentation gives way to disciplined engineering.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="subtext">The gap between demo and production is where most projects die. Plan for it.</p>

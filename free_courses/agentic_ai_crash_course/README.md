## ❗❗Please read before engaging with the course since many influencers have shared incorrect details


**Claim: This course was taught at MIT and Oxford**<br/>
Truth: The instructors have taught professional AI programs at MIT and Oxford, but this specific course was never offered there.

**Claim: This course costs USD 2500 and is now free**<br/>
Truth: This is a short intro course, the heading clearly says "crash course". We would never price this at 2500, it has always been free.

**Claim: This course will change your life and guarantee jobs**<br/>
Truth: This course gives you a solid way to enter the topic, build confidence, and feel good about the space. It is not a magic ticket and we never promise outcomes like that.

We put a lot of care into keeping it simple, useful, and a genuinely good starter. We love that it is getting attention, but we want people to engage with it for the right reasons, not for promises we never made.
